## How to connect the server
We have two ways: ssh & rdp(remote desktop). Usually we prefer ssh, cause it is more easier to use and provide more stable connection. Only if you have to display a real time image on server, you are recommend to use the rdp.  
### ssh(recommend)
Here is the [basic introduction](./Tools/apply_vcm?id=ssh), for more information, please find on the internet.  
You can use ssh via bash, powershell, putty, xshell, vscode.  
I prefer vscode. Here is the [official document](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh).  
Here is the example on [how to connect to server via ssh](./server%20users/firsttime/ssh_example.md)
### remote desktop
You can also use remote desktop, similar to [this](./Tools/remote_to_labpc?id=for-your-own-computer).
