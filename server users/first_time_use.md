If you are the first time to use remote server, here are the basic knowledge you need to learn.  
1. what is Linux/Ubuntu, what is the relationship between them.
2. Remote server is a computer, not a software or an application.  
3. once you connect to remote serverm, all the operations are done on remote side not local side, so the file on your own laptop cannot be easily transmit to remote side. If you want to do this, feel you can use `scp` command.

We provide an example on [how to connect to server via ssh](./server%20users/firsttime/ssh_example.md), and also recommend you to [config git](./server%20users/firsttime/git_config.md) at the first time you login.  

Before you use server, we strongly recommend you to know the [basic commands on Linux](./Tools/linux_commands.md).  

And if you still feel confused about Python & conda, here is a [tutorial](./basics/languages/python/python.md).

> Please Check [Network error solutions](./server%20users/bug_fix/proxy_related.md), this is a confusing feature because of DKU network
