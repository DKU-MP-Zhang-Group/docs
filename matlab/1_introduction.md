# What is Matlab
MATLAB is a business mathematics software produced by MathWorks, an American company, used in data analysis, wireless communication, deep learning, image processing and computer vision, signal processing, quantitative finance and risk management, robotics, control systems and other fields.

# The difference between Matlab and other tools

MATLAB is an abbreviation of '**matrix laboratory**'. MATLABÂ® is primarily used to deal with entire matrices and arrays, whereas most other programming languages deal with numerical values one by one.

All MATLAB variables are **multi-dimensional arrays**, independent of the data type. A matrix is a two-dimensional array usually used to perform linear algebra operations.

# Why Matlab
1. The tools for scientific computing are perfect(fast, accurate, stable)
2. Many tool boxes for multiple functions
3. Easy to use
