```python
import yfinance as yf
# valid intervals: 1m,2m,5m,15m,30m,60m,90m,1h,1d,5d,1wk,1mo,3mo
data = yf.download(tickers="^GSPC", interval="1d", start="1988-01-01", end="2023-12-31")
data.to_csv('./out.csv')
```
# How to deal with data
## package: pandas
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
Pandas is an extension of the Python language library for data analysis.

Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.

Pandas is a powerful tool set for analyzing structured data, based on Numpy (which provides high-performance matrix calculations).

Pandas can import data from various file formats such as CSV, JSON, SQL, and Microsoft Excel.

Pandas can perform computations on various data, such as merging, reshaping, and selecting, as well as data cleaning and data processing characteristics.

Pandas is widely used in various data analysis fields, such as academia, finance and statistics.

## Using pandas to load csv data
### The data structure in pandas
`Series` can be regarded as one dimension array, and `Datafram` can be regarded as two dimension array(matrix).
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data/table.csv')
df.head() # The head(n) method is used to read the first n rows. By default, 5 rows are returned if n is not specified.
df.to_csv('data/new_table.csv') # write the dataframe to csv files
```
Detailed method can be shown in [Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/series.html) and [Dataframe](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html).

However, these documents are too detailed for beginners.
[official user guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) may helps, but they are still a little tedious.
